              <p>Eleven data sets were organized into six categories (supply, demand, inventories, consumption, energy, ICO composite, and retail price). The data sets were composed of metric categories partitioned by year and country. Categories were averaged (i.e. price) or summed (i.e. crop production) by year for each feature category to obtain global benchmarks for analysis. Each category of data was treated equally. 10 features were initially selected to train a machine learning model.</p>

            <p>A random forest regressor model was chosen over a linear regression model due to accuracy. Optimization of the model was evaluated by removing features based on accuracy. After exploring combinations of features, three models were created. The first model contained nine-features with the least impactful one removed. The second model included the ICO Composite and the year. The final model contained ISO composite, year, and Brent annual average. The last two models will be considered for web deployment. The graph contrasts the nine-feature model predicted global retail price vs observed global retail price.</p>

            <p>Model was created in an attempt to predict the average retail price of selected importing countries based on not just supply and demand, but also on weather. This was done by generating average values for each feature at the end of a year to predict the average retail price at the end of the year. The model barely predicted above 50% due to the fluctuations occuring in between the years beeing more accurate accounts than the end of year averages.</p>
