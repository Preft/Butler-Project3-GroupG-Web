            Identified key global economic trends to train a machine learning model for predicting the retail prices of coffee. Economic data considered will span from 1990 to 2018. The final model will attempt to predict the average global retail price for a pound of coffee.

            Data was analyzed and organized into features. The features were tested to find the correlation. The correlation results were used to determine the best machine learning method to use. The chosen machine learning method was then written and trained with the data. The accuracy of the training was reviewed. If a high degree of accuracy for the training, the test data was then run thru the model. The results of the testing data was used to optimize and refine the model. This process of review, analyze, and refine was continued until an iteration with the highest level of accuracy was achieved. When that final iteration is found, the model was then used to predict future values.
